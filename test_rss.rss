<p>Compared to their knowledge of other senses, scientists know relatively little about how cells sense touch. A newly confirmed family of mechanosensors, comprising more than a dozen members and present in both plants and animals, is an important step toward a better understanding. The protein family, called OSCA in plants and TMEM63 in animals, was described in a <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41844">recent <em>eLife</em> study</a>.</p>
<p>“Mechanical forces are everywhere,” says Ching Kung, an emeritus professor who worked in mechanosensitivity at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. For example, plant roots must sense rocks in the soil to go around them, and many animals rely on mechanosensation to measure their own blood pressure. These sensors are also important in disease; for example, a mechanosensor called Piezo2 has been linked to human diseases with symptoms including <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1602812">insensitivity to light touch</a>. (See <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/30/7641">Inner Workings: Unlocking the molecular mechanisms behind our sense of touch</a>) “These findings broaden our horizon and promise deep understanding that is relevant to human physiology and pathology,” says Kung, who was not involved with the new study.</p>
<p>Known mechanosensors convert force into a current of positive ions flowing into a cell. Researchers in the lab of Ardem Patapoutian, at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, were interested in plant genes in the 15-strong OSCA family. Defects in these genes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13593">stunt plant growth</a> under high salt conditions, suggesting they respond to osmotic pressure. But Patapoutian’s team wondered if the OSCA proteins were responding not directly to the osmotic pressure, but to the tension on the cell’s plasma membrane as the cells, withering in salt solution, stretched away from their points of contact with the surrounding cell wall.</p>
<p>To test the ability of OSCAs to sense membrane stress and movement, they sought to express them in a cell type incapable of sensing any such external pressure. So they generated human kidney cultures lacking mechanosensation.</p>
<p>Postdoc Swethy Murthy borrowed OSCA genes from the mustard <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> and put them in the kidney cells. Then she poked the cells with a blunt glass probe, or sucked up a bit of the cell membrane into a tiny pipet to stretch it. This pushing or tugging at the plasma membrane would, presumably, relay a signal to any mechanosensors within that membrane. While perturbing the cells, she measured any influx of ions across their membranes.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the cells expressing OSCAs responded strongly to the pokes and pinches, letting ions in after a deformation of as little as six microns. Among four clades of OSCAs found in plants, members of three responded to Murthy’s prodding or stretching. (It’s still possible the fourth clade contains mechanosensors that didn’t work the same way in the kidney cells, or that required a stronger poke than Murthy gave.)</p>
<p>Did the OSCAs work alone, or did they rely on other parts of the cell to sense membrane tension? To find out, Murthy purified the OSCA1.2 protein and inserted it into membranous bubbles devoid of any other cellular components. Again, the mechanosensor created a current when she stretched the membranes. “These are actually bona fide pore-forming ion channels that sense mechanical force,” Murthy concludes.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers turned to animal proteins in the TMEM63 family, OSCA’s far-flung cousins. Murthy tested TMEM63 proteins from fruit flies, mice, and people, and many responded to a pinch. The presence of similar proteins doing the same job in plants and animals suggests the OSCAs and TMEM63 channels belong to an ancient and important family of mechanosensors, says Murthy.</p>
<p>Her work complements and confirms <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-018-0117-6">another recent study</a>, by researchers at Peking University in Beijing, which also reported that two OSCA family members respond to mechanical sensation. In that study, and <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41845">another in <em>eLife</em></a> also by Patapoutian’s group at Scripps, scientists determined the structure of OSCA family members, which form a double-barreled channel in cell membranes.</p>
<p>“All of these papers taken together seal the deal—this is definitely a family of mechanosensitive channels,” says Elizabeth Haswell, a plant biologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in any of these recent studies. “It makes a great foundation for the next set of experiments.” She’s curious what happens in plant cells after OSCAs open, and how their activity might explain the stunted growth that happens in plants without them.</p>
<p>Murthy and Patapoutian, meanwhile, look forward to studying how exactly OSCA and TMEM63 open when the membranes move, and where in the mammal body different TMEM63 proteins are expressed. Murthy also expects researchers will find diseases that result from deficiencies in TMEM63.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Neurobiologists have captured, for the first time, the moment in a mouse’s brain when it first learns something new: in this case, that a beep signals a delicious droplet of sugar water. The results, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0245-7">recently reported</a> in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, support a famous theory of learning first proposed in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va. sought to distinguish between two competing models for learning governed by the dopamine-producing nerve cells in the midbrain. These neurons, found in all vertebrates, are involved in both movement and learning. One theory of learning, proposed by Donald Hebb in the 1940s, is that the brain learns from the animal’s successes, firing in response to a good thing happening. Another, to which many neurobiologists subscribe, is that animals learn by making mistakes, in a sense comparing their erroneous expectations to reality.</p>
<p>Luke Coddington, a research scientist in Josh Dudman’s lab, saw a problem with the error-based theory: In the very first stages of learning a new fact or skill, how would an ignorant animal know it’s made a mistake? In previous experiments, neuroscientists studied animals that had already been trained in a task. But Coddington wanted to see that first spark of insight, when the mouse realized that a sound indicated a tasty treat. He and Dudman report found that there are two distinct dopamine neuron signals as the mice learn. The results support the Hebbian model of learning early on, with the animals switching to error-based learning once they’ve grasped the task.</p>
<p>Coddington set up the mice in front of a dropper that delivered the sweetened water. A tone would sound; a second and a half later, the treat arrived. The researchers could tell the mouse knew the sugar water was coming if it licked the dropper. Coddington also mounted the mice in a tube dangling from springs, attached to an accelerometer, so he could assess the animals’ degree of fidgeting when they got excited about a potential reward.</p>
<p>During these experiments, Coddington used a glass pipette to reach and eavesdrop on the dopamine-producing neurons in the midbrain. Since those neurons are rare, and intermingled with other types, he used genetically engineered mice with dopamine neurons that responded to a flash of light. By sending that light through the pipette, he could find the right neurons. Then he used the same pipette to record their activity. Neuronal signaling changed as the mouse went from clueless to confident that the tone announced an incoming treat.</p>
<p>Before playing any tones or providing any sugar water, Coddington collected data on baseline neuron activity. When the mouse fidgeted, he saw that activity go down. It’s as if the neurons noted the movement, and that nothing good happened as a result. The result was an early hint that the brain could sense rewards, or in this case, the lack thereof.</p>
<p>Then, during the first couple hundred trials, Coddington observed the mouse responding to the sugary reward. The mice can smell the treat, and would lick for it after it appeared. This resulted in two peaks in dopamine neuron activity: one when the mouse noticed the sugar water, and another right before the moment of licking. In the case of the latter, it’s as if the brain was saying, “I’m about to lick, and I’m pretty sure there’s going to be sweet water,” says Coddington. Imagine, says Dudman, the moment a child reaches for a piece of Halloween candy, knowing it’s going to be good. That’s when the dopamine-making neurons fired—at the moment of certain success.</p>
<p>Over the next few hundred trials, the mouse started to learn that the tone indicated an upcoming reward. As this happened, Coddington observed an additional peak in dopamine neuron firing, when the mouse heard the tone and anticipated the reward. With time, the licking signal moved earlier and earlier, converging with the timing of the tone, so the mouse would start licking as soon as it knew the water was on its way. “That’s when you get your biggest learning,” says Coddington.</p>
<p>The authors, then, had observed dopaminergic neurons involved in both sensing the signs of an upcoming reward, and noting the movement to get it. They suggest that untrained mice, by combining these two signals, could learn from their successes as Hebb proposed. Only after the mice had mastered their task did the learning process start to look like an error-based one.</p>
<p>Neir Eshel, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, praised the study for its innovations in monitoring very early learning as well as mouse movement. “It gives us a new way of thinking about the ultimate goal of the system,” he says. “The goal is to figure out a way to maximize those behaviors that lead to better outcomes.”</p>
<p>But Eshel isn’t ready to say early learning is exclusively Hebbian. “I don’t think their paper conclusively disproves error-based learning at any point during training,” he says. “You could actually have both, simultaneously.”</p>

<p>Fatal neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) begin as tiny pockets of misfolded proteins that evade the body’s normal detritus-removal systems. They spread throughout the brain and clog neural pathways. But exactly how these proteins propagate and spread, and how they relate to brain atrophy, has been notoriously difficult to pin down.</p>
<p>A recent study <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.158101">published</a> in brief in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>, and in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509618307063">greater depth</a> in the <em>Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids</em>, suggests that basic principles of physics can explain the movement of toxic proteins through the brains of people with different forms of neurodegenerative disease. “Each neurodegenerative disease is different, but there are only so many mechanisms by which they can propagate, and that’s something that our model showed,” says study coauthor Johannes Weickenmeier, an engineer at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. A better understanding of how neurodegenerative proteins spread and accumulate during different stages of disease could help improve diagnosis, better predict disease progression, and inform novel treatments.</p>
<p>Weickenmeier and colleagues built a generalized model capable of describing the unique progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. The model combined an anatomical reconstruction of a human brain, clinical data on the originating locations of toxic protein buildup in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ALS patients, as well as a physics-based reaction-diffusion equation that simulates the growth and spread of misfolded proteins throughout brain tissue.</p>
<p>When the researchers seeded their model brain with toxic model proteins, the simulated proteins spread in patterns that matched clinical observations of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or ALS.  Different patterns emerged for each disease even though the model assumed the same mechanism of spread. This suggests that the proteins all use similar modes of transport.</p>
<p>“Despite the apparent complexity of these neurodegenerative diseases, their impact on the brain can be captured in this relatively simple model,” says Lary Walker, an experimental neuropathologist at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>The model also predicted patterns of atrophy, which occur in brain regions where large aggregations of toxic proteins accumulate. Understanding the links between neurodegenerative disease at the cellular or protein levels and disease symptoms at the anatomical or whole brain level could help elucidate the requisite biochemical pathways, and may one day enable diagnosis before symptoms develop. And the model’s apparent non-specificity could make it a useful tool for modeling other neurodegenerative diseases, including CTE.</p>
<p>But those achievements are still a long way off. First, Weickenmeier says, he intends to validate the model’s predictive capabilities using longitudinal, annual MRI scans of Alzheimer’s patients. “It remains to be seen how well the simulations involving individual brain regions coincide with what is known about the formation of protein assemblies in those regions,” says Michel Goedert, neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge in the UK who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>Weickenmeier also intends to refine the model’s predictive abilities by incorporating biological data specific to a particular neurodegenerative disease. “It’s definitely too early to apply it to prediction in a given case,” Walker says. “But as I see it, it’s a foundation for using mathematical modeling as a way of predicting disease progression.”</p>

<p>The human body is home to millions of commensal microbes, some of which—given the right circumstances—can cause disease. One such microbe, known as nontypeable <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> (NTHi), infects the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition that makes sufferers more susceptible to long-term, chronic infections.</p>
<p>These pathogenic strains of NTHi may carry unique genetic traits that enable them to persist in COPD lungs. And not all of them make the bug more virulent: Some of these genetic changes actually reduce the microbe’s ability to survive outside the COPD lung, yet improve its odds of survival in diseased tissue, according to a <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/5/e01176-18">study</a> recently published in <em>mBio</em>.</p>
<p>“The work is exciting because it demonstrates a process that we hypothesized must happen when commensals adapt to unusual disease states,” says University of Pittsburgh microbiologist Vaughn S. Cooper, who was not involved with the study. “It actually shows the consequences of that genetic adaptation for microbial fitness.”</p>
<p>To identify the genetic variations that enable NTHi to adapt to life in the COPD lung, microbiologists Junkal Garmendia of the Public University of Navarra in Spain and Joshua Chang Mell of Drexel University, along with their colleagues, examined the genomes of bacteria isolated from patients’ lungs over a period of one to nine years.</p>
<p>The team collected sputum samples from 13 COPD patients when they visited the hospital for routine checks or during disease flare-ups, and sequenced the genomes of isolated microbes to observe their genetic markers. They then categorized bacteria into groups of isolates that were closely related genetically. Different groups, they found, colonized patients at different points in time. The same group was often re-isolated from the same patient at multiple times or found in different patients. Many groups showed recurrent mutations across several genes.</p>
<p>One of these—a mutation that rendered the <em>fadL</em> gene nonfunctional—appeared in approximately one-third of all the groups. This gene encodes a membrane protein that helps bacteria import long-chain fatty acids, and also binds to a cell surface protein to help the microbe invade human epithelial tissue. The researchers used computational models to test the effects of <em>fadL</em> mutations and found that mutant bacteria would likely lose both these abilities.</p>
<p>But in experimental studies, losing this gene’s functions appeared to be a disadvantage: Mutant bacteria lacking the FadL protein invaded cultured human epithelial cells substantially less than wild-type strains. In a mouse model of lung infections, bacterial numbers for <em>fadL</em> mutants were lower than those of control strains 48 hours after infection.</p>
<p>“This mutation makes the bacteria bad colonizers, so how is it helpful?” asks Mell. “We were confused about how the loss of this gene mattered in chronic infections, so we turned to the protein’s function as a transporter of fatty acids.”</p>
<p>The team compared bacterial growth in minimal media containing fatty acids such as arachidonic acid, which act like detergents and inhibit bacterial growth. Wild-type strains were less viable in the presence of the fatty acid, but <em>fadL</em> mutants were resistant to its antimicrobial effects. “What’s remarkable is the detail with which the work resolves this idea that commensals adapting to new disease states may evolve by losing functions that are costly in other environments but locally beneficial,” Cooper says.</p>
<p>Although the <em>fadL</em> mutation was common in isolates from COPD patients’ lungs, a comparison to publicly available H-flu sequences showed that it’s rare in isolates from other parts of the body— even among pathogenic isolates that cause ear infections or meningitis. “It really impressed us that this mutation was so rare in genomes isolated from other locations,” says Mell, adding that this implies an “important adaptation” allowing the microbe to survive in the COPD lung. “The loss of this gene essentially drives this common commensal to be a pathogen because it can’t grow anywhere else,” Mell says. “There’s a lot to be explored still with how decreasing virulence may actually be a good adaptation for a pathogen.”</p>
<p>“The strategy of capturing <em>in vivo</em> evolution has enormous potential as a tool to learn about key adaptive forces at play during bacterial infections,” adds Carnegie Mellon university microbiologist Luisa Hiller, who was not involved with the work. “We learn about bacterial weaknesses and also about how they adapt to get around the weakness.”</p>

<p>To the mammalian eye, light offers more than just sight. “Light is so important for many innate functions,” says neuroscientist Samer Hattar of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). “We really don’t appreciate the importance of light in our lives.”</p>
<p>The effect of light on mood is especially far reaching—from light-related mood disorders such as seasonal affective disorder, to the depressive symptoms that can accompany jet lag and shift work. Now, Hattar’s team has uncovered the distinct pathways in mice from the retina to the brain that drive the effects of light on mood as well as learning. The findings, reported in <em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418310201">Cell</a></em>, could point to targets for future therapies for light-related mood disorders.</p>
<p>In the 2000’s, Hattar, in collaboration with Brown University’s David Berson and alongside <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/20/2/600.short">work</a> by University of Virginia’s Ignacio Provencio, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5557/1065?casa_token=WVcUViCR_hUAAAAA:ztQ5Vebu_p9HiyeyeB5hu7b6jUauCjr3FfmHNnjtDSkI4aRMNv1xMroS3mKRle7GFu-fHoyPF05kiKc">helped to reveal </a>that the retina houses not only the long-recognized rod and cone cells necessary for vision but also a third cell type that uses light as a cue for regulating circadian rhythms and sleep. In 2012, Hattar’s group <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nature11673">showed</a> that this third group, known as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), is also responsible for light’s effects on mood and learning in mice.</p>
<p>IpRGCs connect to many brain regions. But a subset extend directly to the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the same region that controls circadian rhythms. For the recent study, Hattar’s team first tested whether these particular ipRGCs might be the conduits for light’s effect on learning using a mouse line in which only this subset of ipRGCs functions.</p>
<p>Under light conditions that approximate a normal day-night cycle, these test mice showed similar cognitive functions as control mice. Both groups, for example, had similar interest in investigating novel objects, and both performed similarly well on the Morris water maze, a spatial learning challenge.</p>
<p>The team then exposed the mice to alternating 3.5-hour periods of light and dark. Both control and test mice responded to this light disruption with poorer performances on the cognitive function tests, demonstrating that the ipRGCs extending to the SCN can mediate the light-induced learning difficulties.</p>
<p>The team then tested whether this same subset of ipRGCs also helps drive light’s effect on mood. The researchers again placed the two groups of mice under normal and altered light cycles. In each light environment, they administered the sucrose preference test, in which a lack of preference for sweetened water suggests an inability to feel pleasure. The researchers also performed two tests that assess depression-like behavior by quantifying how quickly a mouse gives up in a stressful situation.</p>
<p>Under normal light conditions, the test and control mice fared similarly. But in the disrupted light environment, the control mice showed depression-like behavior while the test mice were unaffected, suggesting that a different subset of ipRGCs must be responsible for light’s effect on mood.</p>
<p>To identify these ipRGCs and trace their path through the brain, the team probed mouse neural circuits using a series of fluorescent tracers and fiber photometry techniques. They identified ipRGCs that extend to a region that they call the perihabenular nucleus, which they learned is part of the thalamus and targets numerous previously recognized mood regulating centers. By experimentally perturbing this pathway in mice under normal and altered light cycles, the team confirmed its role in driving the effect of light on mood.</p>
<p>The team’s methods are “a real tour de force,” says neuroscientist Colleen McClung of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. “They do a really thorough job of identifying this particular circuitry.”</p>
<p>“This is the first paper that I’ve seen that really convincingly maps the initial response to light from cells within our eyes and connects it to a mood center in the brain,” says neuroscientist Scott Russo of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “What would be interesting in the future, would be to think about what types of drugable molecules could impact these circuits.”</p>
<p>Still, Russo notes that it isn’t yet clear whether these findings could translate into treatments for light-related mood disorders. As for all such studies, it’s hard to know whether a mouse displaying what appears to be depressive behavior is truly depressed in a human sense. And as McClung notes, just “because a circuit is found in a mouse, doesn’t mean it automatically will be the same circuitry in humans.”</p>
<p>In hopes of opening the door to clinical applications, Hattar is currently collaborating with others at NIMH to design fMRI studies that could reveal whether these same circuits are present and responsive to light in humans.</p>

<p>Harvard University evolutionary biologist Naomi Pierce began studying Lycaenidae butterflies as a graduate student in the 1980s. But only recently has she accumulated enough data, from her team’s work and others’, to begin to address the question that has long dogged her: Why is this group of butterflies so diverse?</p>
<p>In a new study published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, her team provides some clues, showing how being specialized can influence the trajectory of evolution. “In a very simple way, if you are more specialized that can promote more biodiversity,” says Pierce of the new findings. “And that is why there are so many of these butterflies.” The family comprises about 5,000 species, about 30% of butterfly species on the planet.</p>
<p>Lycaenidae caterpillars are known for their specialized associations with certain plants or ants, with some species tending to the insects with delectable secretions from their bodies. In turn, the ants can protect against spiders, wasps, and birds, biting them or spitting acid on them. The ants “are pretty savage,” says Pierce.</p>
<p>In the new study, Pierce and her colleagues examined 967 species of Lycaenidae found worldwide, looking at factors such whether the species relies on ants from a single genus for survival (“ant-specialized”) or eats only plants from a single genus (“plant-specialized”), or are generalists (not reliant on specific ants or plants). They correlated these lifestyle data with genetic data obtained from sequencing databases of a mitochondrial gene. They then supplemented these data with their own mitochondrial DNA sequencing efforts, examining at least five individuals of each species.</p>
<p>The researchers went on to compare specialist species with generalist species. They found that, in general, specialized species had a greater variety of genetic changes in the DNA and had greater genetic differences between populations. This finding held for ant-specialized and plant-specialized species, as well as a third category, species that have evolved to eat ants, an even more specialized group. Says Pierce, “These are population genetic measures that might be associated with more rapid rates of diversification.”</p>
<p>The researchers note that evolutionary selection may be driving some of this pattern or it might result in part from isolation of smaller populations of specialists, marooned on ecological islands with specific plants or ants—a process otherwise known as genetic drift. Further studies—for instance detailing the level of isolation of various populations, along with more extensive genetic analyses—might help shed light on this open question, says Douglas Futuyma an evolutionary biologist at Stony Brook University in New York.</p>
<p>Even so, the study goes on to provide insight into an ongoing debate about the forces behind what evolutionary biologists call macroevolution, which involves processes such as the formation of new species, says Zach Gompert, an evolutionary biologist at Utah State University in Logan. Study researchers showed that specialization correlated roughly with higher rates of molecular evolution (which involves DNA base changes) over long time scales, a macroevolutionary pattern. This effect was most pronounced for the most specialized group, species that eat ants.</p>
<p>There is a “pretty big fight” about whether the factors that promote diversity, variation, and genetic differentiation within species are the same things that give rise to macroevolution, says Gompert. “This study is showing that to some extent the answer is yes,” he says.</p>
<p>The findings not only help explain the high diversity of Lycaenidae, but also could provide insight into diversity of other groups of organisms that have specialized members. “The things that make it a powerful study,” adds Gompert, “are the scope and scale of the sampling.”</p>

<p>Confirmation bias is a pervasive phenomenon. Whether it&#8217;s a news article or an additional piece of scientific data, people tend to interpret new information as evidence confirming their prior beliefs—even if it actually doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>“People have been aware of this phenomenon for a very long time,” says Tobias Donner, a neuroscientist at University Medical Center Hamburg. “The problem is that it’s not understood why this phenomenon is there and what brings it about.”</p>
<p>In a new set of experiments, <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30982-5">published</a> in <em>Current Biology</em>, Donner and a team of researchers suggest that confirmation bias arises because people tend to pay more attention to information that&#8217;s consistent with their prior belief. “Attention seems to be the decisive mechanism that brings about this confirmation bias,” Donner says.</p>
<p>The results, he says, is a step toward pinpointing the neural mechanism behind confirmation bias. Ultimately, understanding its underpinnings could help mitigate this bias, whether in the realm of business, politics, or everyday decision-making.</p>
<p>Most of the previous research on confirmation bias has been based on experiments using higher-level reasoning. In this study, the researchers analyzed a lower-level task involving visual perception. “The fact that we observe this confirmation bias even in these low-level decisions tells us it comes from very deep in the decision-making machinery in our brain,” Donner says.</p>
<p>The researchers asked 16 volunteers to look at a cloud of dots on a computer screen. The dots would rapidly move in somewhat random directions, and the volunteers had to determine whether the dots were generally going in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Then, the dots would move again and the volunteers had to move the cursor to align with the angle they thought the dots were moving on average in both cases, relative to a reference line.</p>
<p>The estimated angle, the researchers found, tended to be consistent with whichever direction the volunteers chose in the first part of the task. This was true regardless of which direction the dots were actually moving, demonstrating confirmation bias.</p>
<p>Next, by statistically analyzing the data across thousands of trials, the researchers measured how much the second viewing of moving dots influenced the volunteers’ final decisions. The influence, they found, was greatest when the estimated angle was consistent with the initial decision of whether the dots were moving clockwise or counter-clockwise.</p>
<p>Using a mathematical model of the data, the researchers showed that when the final and initial decisions were consistent, the brain effectively amplified the influence of the second viewing. When the final and initial decisions were not consistent, the brain seemed to suppress the influence of the second viewing.</p>
<p>Other <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(06)00087-7" target="_blank">research</a>, including work in monkeys, has suggested this type of amplification and suppression when explaining how attention works in the brain, notes Jaime de la Rocha, a neuroscientist at IDIBAPS in Barcelona who wasn’t involved in this study. When asked to pay attention to a particular feature—say, a person with a red hat—certain neurons become more attuned to red hats, amplifying the perception of red hats, and suppressing the perception of, say, blue hats. Similarly, by first deciding that a bunch of dots are moving clockwise, the subject may be more attuned and pay more attention to clockwise-moving dots rather than other dots moving differently.</p>
<p>But while the new analysis is careful and compelling, it may be too early to conclude that attention is at the heart of confirmation bias. “It&#8217;s certainly a plausible mechanism,” says Alan Stocker, a computational psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania who also was not involved in this study. But to determine exactly what’s going on, he says, you would need a model that explains how such behavior arises, and not just one that describes the data, as is the case in this study.</p>
<p>The researchers found similar results involving a more complex task, in which they asked volunteers to determine the average value of a series of numbers. It’s less certain, however, how much selective attention can explain confirmation bias in higher-level processes like evaluating numbers, de la Rocha says. There hasn&#8217;t yet been much evidence linking attention to such tasks.</p>
<p>Still, he says this is one of the first studies linking confirmation bias with any mechanism, and could therefore offer insights into how to reduce the harm from broader instances of bias—even if we’re still a long way from fully understanding how a social media feed biases political opinions. “You could say this is a first step to understanding what&#8217;s going on at that level,” he says.</p>

<p>Engineers have long dreamed of tapping into the vast quantities of renewable energy available in the motion of ocean waves, but designing apparatuses to harness such power efficiently has so far proven difficult. Borrowing a technique from optical physics, a team has <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.104501">shown a new way</a> to concentrate waves, tripling their height and allowing for better extraction of their energy.  The results appeared in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>
<p>The constant churning of the ocean should in principle be a useful source of electricity—a mechanical lever moving back and forth with the waves could run a turbine that produces power. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior, estimates that the total recoverable energy available along the U.S. coast could be <a href="https://www.boem.gov/Ocean-Wave-Energy/">1,170 terawatt-hours/year</a>, or roughly one-third of the country’s total energy needs.</p>
<p>During the 1970s oil crisis, interest in all kinds of renewable energies spiked, but wave power development has since lagged behind solar and wind. More than 1,000 different wave energy converter designs have been proposed, but researchers have yet to converge on the optimal form.</p>
<p>Some versions consist of simple buoys moving up and down, while others are hollow floating boxes. Still other types of concentrators send waves up a small ramp and then allow them to drain through a hole and run a turbine, explains mechanical engineer Robert Thresher of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. None is inexpensive and reliable enough to see the given technique more widely deployed, he says.</p>
<p>In 2012, physicist Huanyang Chen of Xiamen University in China, who was working on using metamaterials to concentrate microwaves, ran into Zhenyu Wang, a hydraulics and ocean engineer at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, at a scientific meeting. “We have a totally different background,” says Chen. “But when we came together, it was a perfect combination.”</p>
<p>The same equations describe both water waves and electromagnetic waves, so Chen was able to use his optics expertise to help design a new type of concentrating tank. The device consists of 50 thin metal sheets arranged in circle like vertical flower petals, allowing water to flow through them from any direction. A small open area in the central meeting point of the sheets has a floor raised relative to the outer edge of the device.</p>
<p>Water waves are focused through the slits and sent up small ramps. The difference in height scrunches the waves and raises their height. The team built two designs, a small 70-millimeter-diameter version that doubled wave heights and a larger 43-centimeter device that succeeded in tripling the amplitudes of certain waves, allowing them to impart more force on a mechanical lever that generates electricity. Not all waves received the same boost—the devices were optimized for certain frequencies: 4.95 and 7.05 Hertz for the small version and 1.5 Hertz for the larger one. But even those outside this range received some increase in their height. Chen says their next iteration should work for a broad range of frequencies.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the design also suppresses any back-scattering waves. In many other wave concentrating devices, these waves often travel in an unintended direction and counteract the power-generating waves.</p>
<p>Thresher, who was not involved in the work, says the design is clever, especially since its circular symmetry can capture waves coming in from any direction. But, he says, wave power devices need to demonstrate more than added efficiency—most of the cost comes from building a rigging that can withstand the harsh oceanic weather, including extreme wave events that overwhelm a power station. “That’s the trick,” he says. “How do you withstand the storm waves?”</p>
<p>Chen says the team is now working on a version that is around 10 times bigger than their larger device. He hopes to test in near-shore shallow waters where inclement weather is less of a problem.</p>

<p>Initiatives to protect marine ecosystems could do more harm to marine life than good, according to a recent PNAS paper<em>.</em> The <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/08/21/1802862115">work</a> suggests that the announcement of one of the world’s largest marine protected areas sparked a sudden uptick in fishing, threatening the initiative’s goals before the protections were even in place.</p>
<p>In 2015, the government of the Republic of Kiribati, an archipelago situated in the heart of the Pacific Ocean, designated 408,459 km² of water as a marine reserve. The region, nearly the size of California, includes the waters around the remote Phoenix Islands. Fisherman became aware of the impending ban in late 2013, and upped their activities before fishing was outlawed, says coauthor Grant McDermott, an environmental and resources economist at Oregon State University. In fact, in the lead up to the ban, the researchers saw fishing activity more than double—the equivalent to an extra 1.5 years’ worth of fishing—before falling again to around zero after the ban was put in place.</p>
<p>McDermott says it’s not yet clear if the fishing surges will have long lasting impacts on marine ecosystems. If the only impact is a short-term fishing effort “then 1.5 years isn’t so bad in the scheme of things,” he says. But there could be hidden longer term impacts. “It could push fish populations past a critical threshold, or trigger irreversible habitat destruction,” McDermott warns.</p>
<p>The research is the first to examine how marine resources are affected by the announcement of new conservation initiatives. <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150781">Previous work</a> has found that land-based conservation initiatives and climate policies also tend to suffer from preemptive behavior that undermines the policy goal.</p>
<p>The PNAS study used open source satellite data on fishing vessels’ movements and positions from a variety of sources including their automatic identification system (AIS), a GPS-like device that large ships are required to use. McDermott and colleagues modeled total daily fishing hours per 1,000km² in the Phoenix Island protected area and in control regions around the Line and Gilbert islands, also part of the Kiribati archipelago.</p>
<p>The researchers were not expecting to find the surge in fishing because they assumed the activity was already at its maximum. “It’s a surprising result,” agrees Sarah Lester, who studies marine conservation and sustainable fisheries management at Florida State University. “Fishing was already unregulated, so you would have expected fishermen to take as much as they can already,” she says.</p>
<p>McDermott and his team suggest similar impacts could be affecting other marine protected areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is pushing to safeguard at least 30% of the ocean in marine reserves by 2030. If the IUCN goal is achieved, McDermott and his colleagues estimate that fishing bursts could lead to a 7% rise in the number of depleted fisheries, affecting nearly three quarters of all fishing areas.</p>
<p>Lester urges caution in broadly applying the results to marine protected areas. “The study is based on a single protected area so it’s hard to know how general the results are,” she says.</p>
<p>Marine reserves are still a useful conservation policy, she adds. “These results alone shouldn’t make us be reticent to establish marine reserves because they won’t be effective,” says Lester. “It might just take longer than expected to see the biological benefits.”</p>
